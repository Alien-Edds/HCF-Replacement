# HCF Replacement

## How does this work?
This essentially just adds a new way to make custom components.

To add/edit custom components, you can go to `data.ts/data.js` in `scripts/Custom Components/Custom Block Components/` and `scripts/Custom Components/Custom Block Components/`.

Yes, you'll still need components like `minecraft:tick` and `minecraft:random_tick` for block events.

There are example block and item files along with custom components. To see all options even if you're writing in js, look at the TS interface files.

## Why was this made?
This was made to help people that don't know how to script, but still make addons.
