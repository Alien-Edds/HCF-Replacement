# HCF Replacement

## How does this work?
To add new custom components, you can go to `data.ts/data.js` in `scripts/Custom Components/Custom Block Components/` and `scripts/Custom Components/Custom Block Components/`.

## Why was this made?
This was made to help people that don't know how to script, but still make addons.
